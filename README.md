# FriendFinder

FriendFinder is an app which helps users to find friends. 

# How it works 

1. It takes in results from  users' surveys

![survey](/app/public/img/1.png)

2. Then compares their answers with those from other users.

![submit](/app/public/img/2.png)

 The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

The answers are saved at friends.js file.
